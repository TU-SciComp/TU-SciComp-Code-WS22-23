### TO DO: Change your Graph and Cholesky Assignments (Week 6 & Week 7) into a Templated Version.

1.The ***Graph assignment*** should have the ***Nodes*** and  the ***Weights templated***.

  Example: class Graph<typename Node_T, typename Weight_T>.

  Use ***Graph_instances*** to test your code.

  Try with ***char***, or ***unsigned char*** as ***Node_T*** and see whether your code works correct for the corner cases of graphs with 127 or 255 nodes and what happens with 128 and 256. 

2.The ***Cholesky assignment*** should have the ***elements of the matrix templated***.

  Try with ***float***, ***double***, ***long double***, and ***__float128*** (if possible).

  Use ***Matrix_instances*** to test your code and see whether there is a difference.
  
  3. Try to make a useful/insightful test and ***write a short report on the results (ADD this to Written Part)***.
